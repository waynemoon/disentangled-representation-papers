This is a curated list of papers on disentangled (and an occasional "conventional") representation learning. Within each year, the papers are ordered from newest to oldest. I've scored the importance/quality of each paper (in my own personal opinion) on a scale of 1 to 3, as indicated by the number of stars in front of each entry in the list. If stars are replaced by a question mark, then it represents a paper I haven't fully read yet, in which case I'm unable to judge its quality.
